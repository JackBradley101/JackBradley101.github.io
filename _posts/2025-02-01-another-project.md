This is another example project post. Create files like this in the `_posts` folder to add more projects.

## File Naming Convention

Blog posts should be named: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md`

For example:
- `2025-03-15-my-robot-project.md`
- `2024-12-01-cfd-simulation.md`

## Front Matter

The section at the top between `---` is called "front matter" and contains metadata:

- `layout`: Should be "post" for project posts
- `title`: The title of your project
- `date`: When you published it (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `tags`: Categories for your project (as a list)
- `image`: A featured image for the project card (optional)

## Writing Content

After the front matter, write your content in Markdown:

- Use `#` for headers (## for h2, ### for h3, etc.)
- Use `**bold**` for **bold text**
- Use `*italic*` for *italic text*
- Use `[text](url)` for links
- Use `![alt text](image-url)` for images
- Use triple backticks for code blocks

## Images

You can store images in an `assets` or `images` folder:

```markdown
![Description](/images/my-project-screenshot.png)
```

That's it! Happy blogging!
